# React Admin Dashboard

The goal of this project is to learn how to work with [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/), [formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview#installation), [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup), [fullcalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/docs) & [nivo](https://nivo.rocks/components/).\
Also practice certain implementations like dark and light mode, & the use of data grid.


##  Is this an original project?

No, I saw a video from EdRoh on how to build a complete react admin dashboard.
